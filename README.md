# Web Portfolio v2

Updated my web portfolio, trying to implement ReactJS and Router on it for learning purposes and to show my projects.

## Learned

* Use of DNS, Domains and Hosting.
* Passing props.
* Fixing Viewport problems on large and small devices.
* Routing.
* Use of components, states.
* Sass.
* MDBootstrap.

## Difficulties

I had some difficulties trying to use Github Pages because is not smart enought to use React's Route component out of the box.

Thanks to Brendan Mclhenny who had the same issue.

[Host single page react app on Github Pages](https://itnext.io/so-you-want-to-host-your-single-age-react-app-on-github-pages-a826ab01e48)

> [...] "when I manually navigated to certain URLS like “<https://bmcilhenny.github.io/trivia-front-end/edit”> I stumbled into a 404 error. I could reach this route via my Nav bar on my home page but after I refreshed GitHub was still spewing out a 404 error. It took me another hour to realize that this is GitHub’s issue, not mine. Due to the way GitHub converts your React app into a GitHub-like repo it always looks to the index.html file to render. So you need to add a script to your index.html file to hackily redirect from the index.html file to the correct component."
